The react cdns have two links because of react uses in different ways or platforms so to make the core functionalites of web into one and dom ?

You're on the right track! Let me clarify it clearly:

When using React via CDNs (instead of bundlers like Webpack or tools like Create React App), you typically include two CDN links:

React core library:
react.development.js or react.production.min.js
This contains the core React API â€” like React.createElement, useState, useEffect, etc.

React DOM library:
react-dom.development.js or react-dom.production.min.js
This provides the methods to render React components into the DOM, like ReactDOM.render() or ReactDOM.createRoot().

Why are there two libraries?
React is designed to be platform-agnostic at its core. This means:

The React core handles the logic for components, hooks, and the virtual DOM.

The React DOM package provides the web-specific rendering implementation.

This separation allows React to be used in other environments too, such as:

React Native for mobile apps

React 360 or React VR

Ink for command-line interfaces

Each of these platforms has its own renderer package (like react-native, react-ink, etc.) that works with the same React core.

Summary
Yes, React uses two CDN links because:

react contains platform-independent core logic

react-dom contains the web-specific rendering logic

This modularity makes React flexible and adaptable to different platforms beyond just the web.
